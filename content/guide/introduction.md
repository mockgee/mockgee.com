`Mockgee` is a Nodejs based APIs mocking server that also provides a user interface for working with **mock APIs**. It is designed to provide consumable APIs available to developers even before actual APIs are ready. `Mockgee` lets you create a replica of your target API with **100% technical capability**. Create multiple combinations of request-response for an API's resource.
